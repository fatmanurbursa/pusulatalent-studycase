# SQL Study Case: Pusula Talent Academy 2025 - SQL & DBA Case Study

This project involves running various SQL queries on predefined tables. The main goal is to generate meaningful insights using SQL skills.

## Files

solution.sql: Contains all SQL queries with explanations.

solution.pdf: PDF version with descriptions.

## How to Use

1. Copy the contents of solution.sql into a SQL editor.

2. Each query includes a comment explaining its purpose.



## ‚ùì Questions

Question 1: Performance & Scalability Analysis in Hospital Data
Scenario:
A table below has been used for 5 years in a Hospital Information Management System (HBYS). Each day, about
25,000 rows are inserted.
Recently, queries on this table have become slower and users have reported difficulty accessing past records.


CREATE TABLE HastaIslemLog (
 Id INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY,
 HastaId INT,
 IslemTarihi DATETIME,
 IslemKodu NVARCHAR(20),
 Aciklama NVARCHAR(500)
);


Question:
1. What could be the reasons for the performance degradation?
2. What improvements would you suggest for better sustainability?
3. Do you think using the table in this way for 5 years was the correct approach? Why or why not?

Note: Open-ended. Focus on reasoning, not just query writing.

Question 2: Index Strategy & Query Optimization Thinking

Scenario:
The following query is frequently used by end users:

SELECT *
FROM HastaKayit
WHERE LOWER(AdSoyad) LIKE '%ahmet%' AND YEAR(KayitTarihi) = 2024

Question:
1. What performance problems might arise from this query?
2. How would you optimize this query and/or the table structure?
3. Are there any improvements that could be made on the application side?

Note: Expect analysis and optimization suggestions.

Question 3: T-SQL Query Challenge (Hospital Sales Example)

Scenario:
In the HBYS system, the hospital pharmacy sells products. Sales and product details are stored in the following tables:


CREATE TABLE Urun (
 UrunID INT PRIMARY KEY,
 UrunAdi NVARCHAR(100),
 Fiyat DECIMAL(10,2)
);

CREATE TABLE Satis (
 SatisID INT PRIMARY KEY,
 UrunID INT FOREIGN KEY REFERENCES Urun(UrunID),
 Adet INT,
 SatisTarihi DATETIME
);


Sample Data:
-- Urun
(1, 'Laptop', 15000.00), (2, 'Mouse', 250.00), (3, 'Klavye', 450.00)
-- Satis
(1, 1, 2, '2024-01-10'), (2, 2, 5, '2024-01-15'), (3, 1, 1, '2024-02-20'),
(4, 3, 3, '2024-03-05'), (5, 2, 7, '2024-03-25'), (6, 3, 2, '2024-04-12')


Tasks:
1. Write a query that returns, per year and per product, the total sales amount (Fiyat * Adet) and total quantity.
2. For each year, identify the product with the highest sales amount.
3. Write a query to list products that were never sold.


Note: Use MSSQL syntax.
